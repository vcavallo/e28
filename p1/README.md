# Project 1

## Outside resources
- [emitting custom events](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html)

## Notes for instructor
- I've had issues going to the .dev domain above... It worked for me on Chrome, but not on Firefox. I read that firefox forces https on `.dev` domains, so I tried to set up SSL on cloudflare but so far it's not working out. Let me know if you ultimately cannot access it and I'll move the project to a different domain!
- My style is generally to use sometimes verbose but explicit method and variable names _in place of comments_. I aim to not need too many comments, but added some where the code doesn't speak for itself.
- It's ugly :) I spent nearly zero time on layout and beautifying. The minimal styling is purely for function.
