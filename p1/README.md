# Project 1

## Outside resources
- [emitting custom events](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html)

## Notes for instructor
- My style is generally to use sometimes verbose but explicit method and variable names _in place of comments_. I aim to not need too many comments, but added some where the code doesn't speak for itself.
- It's ugly :) I spent nearly zero time on layout and beautifying. The minimal styling is purely for function.
